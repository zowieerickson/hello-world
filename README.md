# hello-world
Hi! This is my first repository on GitHub.

I am currently an ESL teacher working in Vietnam who is looking forward to make a career shift into the software development sphere. I have been coding and studying programming since July 14, 2020 and have finally found my way here on GitHub! My learning is focused on front-end web development, so I have been learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript and will be learning React in the future.

I graduated with a Bachelors from the University of Florida, and I currently live in Sarasota, Florida. My favorite hobbies include collecting houseplants, playing online games with my friends and feeding crickets to my pet chameleon. I look forward to putting more projects here on GitHub and learning all there is about computer science and programming.
